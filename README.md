1. Always dry-run new programs in simulation before live cutting.
2. Verify tool offsets and work offsets before first cut.
3. Ensure proper tool and workholding setup; use runout and balancing checks for high-speed tools.
4. Use coolant and proper chip evacuation strategies for deep pockets.
5. Lock spindle and axes during program upload if available.
6. Keep E-stop and door interlocks functional.
